# QR Journal Club: Quantitative Research Trainings, Mentorship, and Collaboration 

Welcome to the **QR Journal Club** repository. We are a community-driven platform dedicated to advancing technical proficiency and research excellence across multiple scientific domains. Our guiding principle is simple: **We Share Knowledge Generously.**

## Our Mission
To bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application in quantitative research through peer-to-peer mentorship, hands-on training, and interdisciplinary collaboration.



## Core Focus Areas

Our club focuses on four primary pillars of quantitative inquiry:

### 1. Biostatistics
* **Focus:** Experimental design, hypothesis testing, and advanced modeling in clinical and biological research.
* **Tools:** R (Tidyverse, lme4), Python (SciPy, Statsmodels).

### 2. Genomics & Bioinformatics
* **Focus:** High-throughput data analysis, RNA-seq dynamics, and the study of regulatory signaling axes (e.g., GAS5/miR-21/PTEN).
* **Tools:** Nextflow, Bioconductor, and specialized R/Python libraries for genomic visualization.

### 3. Epidemiology
* **Focus:** Population health dynamics, disease surveillance, and causal inference.
* **Application:** Translational research and longitudinal study designs.

### 4. Natural Sciences
* **Focus:** Integration of quantitative methods into the broader physical and biological sciences to drive evidence-based discovery.



## How We Collaborate

We believe that the best research happens when we break down silos. Our collaboration model includes:

* **Weekly Journal Clubs:** Deep dives into high-impact papers to critique methodology and data interpretation.
* **Code Reviews:** Helping members optimize their R and Python scripts for reproducible research.
* **Mentorship:** Connecting seasoned quantitative researchers with students and early-career professionals.
* **Resource Sharing:** Open-source datasets, scripts, and learning pathways.


## Getting Started

To contribute or access our training materials:
1.  **Clone the Repo:** `git clone https://github.com/Atwau/QR-Journal-Club.git`
2.  **Explore Data:** Check the `data/` directory for medical datasets.
3.  **Scripts:** Look into the `scripts/` folder for our standardized analysis workflows.


## Share Knowledge Generously
If you have a script, a dataset, or a unique insight into a quantitative problem, we encourage you to open a Pull Request or start a Discussion.
